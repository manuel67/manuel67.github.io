        <i><p>This page is to tell you more about my self.I would tell you three things about me, so one thing about me is that I was raised and born in Boston,MA for 11 years! The second thing about me is that I love the snow and the ice. The final thing that is about me is that I joined this program to learn how to code so it could help me for the future.
